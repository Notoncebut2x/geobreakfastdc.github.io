### Recomendded Breakfast Places

[Lincoln's Waffle Shop](http://www.lincolnswaffleshop.com/)

### Updating the breakfast Location

First you'll want to grab the [latitude & longitude](http://www.latlong.net/) values for wherever the new location is.

The map center & star location are both based on a value defined at the top of the main.js file called `breakfastCoors`. Replacing the previous coordinates there will update both!

### Editing the CSS

CSS for this site is written initially in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). To learn how to use it and convert the scss file into css, you can read [instructions here.](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html)

If you already have Sass installed on your computer, you'll just need to navigate to the styles folder in your terminal & run

`sass -watch main.scss`
